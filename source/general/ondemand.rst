Queue
~~~~~

Allows you to select the queue your application will run on. General is typical for most jobs. GPU and High Memory are available for specialized work loads, but there are a limited number of nodes with these resources.

Number of Hours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the number of hours your interactive application will run for. Please note there is a 48 hour limit on all interactive app jobs. If you require longer runtimes, please utilize a SLURM script.

.. #TODO: Add link to SLURM script section 

Number of Cores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number of cores for your job. You can reserve up to 20, but only use the minimum required. Two is typically best for classroom jobs, and most research jobs. Twenty will reserve the entire node for just that application. This should only be done when absolutely needed. 

Version
~~~~~~~

This selects the version of the application you wish to run. Most often, you will want to pick the latest version, unless you have some need that requires an older revision.

Additonal Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional modules can be added here. This utilizes LMOD, and will automatically load the user supplied list of modules. Please be sure your modules toolchain version matches the toolchain of your software version. You can read more in the module section about toolchains.

.. #TODO: Add a link to the module section

Other Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain applications contain other options. For example, Jupyter let's you choose between a Lab or Notebook session. Jupyter also offers ready to select module groups like "Data Science".  

File Browser
------------

Ondemand offers a built in file browser. You can access it by going to Files>Home Directory. The file browser has options to upload files, edit text files, general file management, and more all within the web browser! Applications like Filezilla are no longer needed to move data to and from Buddy.

  :align: center
  :alt: Buddy OnDemand File Editor

|

There are a number of options available within the editor

File Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Save**: Saves your currently open file
* **Path**: Shows the name and location of the file you currently have open

Editor Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Key Bindings**: Allows for special key bindings
  
   * **Default**: This option is best for most users as this is the standard set of key bindings to which desktop users are accustom.  
   * **Vim**: VIM types bindings, including common modes such as command, insert, replace, and block. This mode is not recommended unless you use VIM. 
   * **Emacs**: Emacs type bindings. This mode is not recommended unless you use Emacs.

* **Font Size**: Size of font displayed within the editor
* **Mode**: This is typically automatically selected based on your file extension. The mode controls syntax highlighting and can help to discern elements when performing tasks like writing a script.
* **Theme**: Changes how your text editor looks. Both light and dark themes are available.
* **Word Wrap**: Marks whether to wrap words. This prevents having to scroll horizontally for extremely long lines. 

Terminal Access
---------------

A terminal can be accessed by going to Clusters>Buddy Shell Access. This terminal is web based will open a terminal in a new window. This means that applications like Putty are no longer needed to access Buddy.

  :alt: Buddy OnDemand Terminal

|

Much like the text editor, the terminal also has a theme option. To learn more about bash and common Linux commands, see our guide on the terminal and Slurm. 

.. #TODO: Add a link to the "Using The Terminal" and "Slurm" section.

Job Management
--------------

Jobs Management can be accessed by going to Jobs>Active Jobs. This allows users to manage their slurm jobs, as well as see jobs from other users running on the cluster. Please see our Slurm section for more information about jobs. Please note that this application is paginated, and you may need to mark to show more entires or click through available pages using the navigation at the bottom.

* **Show ## Entries**: Change the number of entries to show on a single page

Job Context Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All jobs have an associated context menu that can be seen be clicking the arrow next to the job. Note the below screenshot is what will be seen for self owned jobs. Jobs owned by other users will be lacking many of these options as you don't have permission to modify them.

Creating Job From Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we will look at creating a job from a template. The process is roughly the same for a default template as well. This example will use Gaussian. Please see the Software and Slurm sections of the documentation for details on writing Slurm scripts and how to use your desired application. 

1. Select "From Template" from the "New Job" menu.
 
.. image:: /_static/img/ondemand_composer_create_01.png

  :align: center
  :alt: Buddy OnDemand Job Composer Create

|

2. From the template screen, select the desired template and click "Create New Job" from the right hand pane. For this example, we will select the Gaussian template. Be sure to also set the desired job name. We will ignore the Cluster option, as Buddy is currently the only available cluster.

|

3. We will now need to make some modifications to our script and upload the input file we want. Select your job and click "Edit Files" on the left side. This will open the file browser in a new window. Upload your input files and edit the Slurm script accordingly. Please see the File Browser and File Editor section of the documentation. Please also see the Slurm documentation for writing your script.

|

4. Once everything is setup, we can click submit job. If everything goes as expected, you should see the job pass through several states, eventually reaching completion. To stop a job, simply press the stop button. Output can be viewed by pressing the "Open Dir" button in the bottom right, or using the edit button in the upper left. Should a job not complete as expected.

Modifying Job Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Certain job options can be modifying by selecting the desired job and clicking "Job Options".

* **Name**: Name of your job
* **Cluster**: Name of the cluster your job will run on. Since we only have one cluster, Buddy, this option is irrelevant. 
* **Specify Job Script**: Specify the name of the script to be executed when the submit button is pressed within the job composer.
* **Account**: We do not currently use accounting. Please leave this field blank. 
* **Job Array Specification**: Please see Advanced Slurm topics for more information on configuring arrays.

You can reset any changes made with the reset button, or by clicking back.

Saving and Managing Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User's can save and manage Templates under the "Templates" tab of the Job Composer. System provided Job Composer templates are only available for a limited number of software. We are currently working to add more to OnDemand. Generic Slurm templates are available under the Slurm section and specific templates are available in the SOFTWARE section.
