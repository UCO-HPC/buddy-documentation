Data Storage
============

Home Folder
-----------
Every user is given 500Gb of storage in their home directory. If more storage is required consider using scratch storage or contact administration to see about allocating more space.

Project Space
-------------
If you are working with a group of users you might want to consider using a project space. Upon request we will create a directory and grant a group of users access to it with one user being the owner. We will also adjust read and write permissions to suit the needs of your group.

Scratch Storage
---------------
If you have a large amount of data that needs to be stored or if you have data that is generated and doesn't need to be stored for a long time consider using scratch storage. Scratch storage is large but volitile to data stored here needs to be backed up off site or disposible.
