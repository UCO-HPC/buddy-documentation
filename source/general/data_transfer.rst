Data Transfer
=============
Data transfer to and from buddy can be done in several ways depending on your needs and the size of the data.

Using SFTP or SCP
-----------------
Small files can be transfered to and from Buddy using a file transfer protol such as SFTP or SCP however, for files greater than 2Gb, please use Globus to increase upload speed and to avoid slowing down the cluster for other users.

Using Github
------------
For source code it might be preferrable to use git to keep data on Buddy synced with a project. This is acomplished by commiting changes on your local machine, pushing them up to a repository, and pulling the changes down onto Buddy. However, if the file size is greater than 2Gb, please use Globus to increase upload speed and to avoid slowing down the cluster for other users.

Using Globus
------------
For files that are larger than 2Gb, Globus is the prefered method for moving data between the cluster and another source. This can be accomplished by doing the following:
