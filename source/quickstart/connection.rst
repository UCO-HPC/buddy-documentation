Connecting to Buddy
===================

Getting an Account
--------------
Please contact us at hpc@uco.edu to have an account created. If you are a research student or external researcher collaborating with a UCO faculty member, you will need to have that faculty member contact us on your behalf with your full name and email address to create an account for you. Please read the :doc:`rules and guidelines</quickstart/etiquette>` before using Buddy.

Connecting Through Open Ondemand
-----------------------------
If you prefer to use a browser, you can access Buddy through hpc.uco.edu. This will take you to our Open Ondemand page which makes it easy to set up jobs and use graphical software. See :doc:`Open Ondemand </general/ondemand>` for more information.

Connecting Through SSH
-------------------
If you prefer a terminal, you can connect to buddy using ssh. See :doc:`Using the Terminal </general/terminal>` for more information.
