Linux on Buddy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Buddy uses linux as its operating system. Many of the day to day operations are similar to other operating systems like Window and MacOS. For more information see: :doc:`files` and :doc:`../general/terminal`.

What is a Slurm Job?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A job is a convenient way to execute code on Buddy. A job script is created which sets up the environment, loads relevant modules, and executes one or several commands. When the job is run with slurm it is placed in a queue until the requested resources are available and then it is executed. For more information about SLURM jobs see: :doc:`basic_job`, :doc:`../general/slurm`, and :doc:`../general/modules`.
